## 📦 Deployment Architecture

The application is structured as a **monorepo** and is optimized to run under a single server instance on **Render**:
1. **Frontend Compilation:** Built into static web assets (`dist/`).
2. **Static Asset Serving:** The backend Express server serves the frontend static assets from `frontend/dist` on any non-API request (`/*`).
3. **Database Integration:** Both the local environment and production servers communicate directly with the Supabase database instance.

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure PostgreSQL or Supabase credentials are configured in your backend environment. Run the seed script to set up tables and create the default admin account:
```bash
cd backend
# Run migration schema and seeds
DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-connection-string" node setup-db.js
```

### 2. Run the App Locally
From the project root:
```bash
# Install dependencies in both folders
npm run install-all


# Start both backend and frontend development servers concurrently
npm start
```
- **Frontend URL:** `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend URL:** `http://localhost:5000`
